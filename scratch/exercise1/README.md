### Preparations

Open <https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10015060> in a browser.


---

### Tasks

1. Instead of dancing up and down, Pico should dance between the costumes 01a-2 and 01b-2
2. After dancing 5 times Pico should move slowly to the right and get smaller at the same time
3. When a space key was pressed the dance party should start again

### Hint

* Try to understand which building blocks have what kind of color
* When clicking on dance party it will just run the dance party instead of the intro and the dance party
