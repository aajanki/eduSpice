### Tasks

1. Instead of showing "THE END" when the ball reaches the goal, show "HIT THE WALL. TRY AGAIN." when the ball hits one of the walls and also hide the bell.
2. Show "YOU WON! THE END." when the ball reaches the goal.
3. Skip the welcome screen saying "THE MAZE" and begin the game without delay.

### Hint

* If one block of instructions interferes with another, you will have to remove it first.
* You can duplicate existing blocks by right clicking on them and choosing "duplicate".
