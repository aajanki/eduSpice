### Preparations

Open `index.html` in a browser and in a text editor. Look at the existing code in `index.html` and then try to modify it to complete the tasks below. You will need to modify the JavaScript.

Links that will help you complete the tasks are:

### Tasks

1. Fix the test that's broken.
2. Add a test for the `packPresent` function.
3. Write a test to make sure that SantaClause does not try to deliver more presents than he has loaded. After writing the test and seeing it fail, change the code so it throws an error if he doesn't have any more packages to deliver.
4. Change the code of `deliverPresents`, so SantaClause packs enough presents before delivering them.
5. Add another object `Reindeer` that has a function `feed`, which makes it more happy. Write an appropriate test before writing the code and check that the test passes when the code is written and the reindeer is happier indeed.
